Google App Engine Wink Example
------


This project can be used to quickly set-up a Wink-enabled JAX-RS App Engine project.

As an example, two resources have been added:
- XMPPResource
- MailResource

These can be used to handle incoming mail/ xmpp communication.


Add your required resources in <code>war/WEB-INF/resources</code>.
